## Case Background

The fictitious country of Storslysia is acutely threatened by the impact of climate-related catastrophes that are increasing over time due to climate change. Storslysia has diverse geography; different geographic regions are subject to different current and future threats from catastrophic climate-related events. Residents who live in the areas at high threat run the risk of permanent displacement when catastrophic events occur. The residents of Storslysia are keenly aware of these threats, both to the individuals who live in areas at risk as well as to the overall economy of Storslysia. 

The leaders of Storslysia are highly motivated to manage the risks associated with catastrophe-related displacement and wish to consider implementing a social insurance program to help manage its exposure to the financial impacts of mass displacement due to these events.

## 1 Objectives

### 1.1 Objective of Proposed Program Design

Our team has been requested by Storslysia to design a social insurance program which provides coverage for both voluntary and involuntary displacement. The purpose of the program is to manage Storslysia’s exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic climate-related events, and to prevent relocation costs from exceeding 10% of its GDP each year with 90% certainty. Storslysia has confirmed that they require the program to cover the entire population, and we have incorporated benefits varying by geographic risk and socio-economic status within the program design in response to Storslysia’s diverse geography.

### 1.2 Key Metrics

The following table summarises several key metrics to be reported semi-annually to assist in monitoring the success of the proposed program across the short and long-term. 


## 2 Program Design

### 2.1 Eligibility Requirements

All citizens of Storslysia may file a claim under the proposed program given they meet the following eligibility requirements:

### 2.2 Claim Coverage

As mentioned in Section 1.1, our proposed program provides coverage for both voluntary and involuntary displacement on the basis that costs have historically been higher for involuntary relocation. The amount of coverage offered to the claimant will vary depending on factors such as property value and geographical risk, with a limit of one claimant per household affected.
Our program provides the following benefits:
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz1.png)

#### 2.2.1 Voluntary Relocation
We have determined the primary cost associated with voluntary relocation to be accommodation search/construction. Under our proposed program, successful claimants will receive a portion of their current property value based on the percentage reduction in risk exposure from relocating from region A to region B as a lumpsum. By basing the lumpsum benefit on the reduction in risk exposure, we aim to mitigate displacement risk and incentivise citizens to relocate to safer regions.  

The value of the payout for this benefit is calculated as follows:
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz2.png)

The subsidised amount, expressed as a percentage of current property value under the voluntary relocation scheme is outlined in table below:
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz3.png)


#### 2.2.2 Involuntary Displacement
Our proposed program accounts for a range of payments in relation to involuntary displacement including accommodation search/construction, temporary accommodation, and the repair/replacement of household items. 

Lump-sum payments for accommodation search/construction is based on property damage under the assumption that the claimant will relocate to an accommodation of similar value. Similarly, lump-sum payments for repair/replacement of household items are set to be 57.5% of household costs based on given data.

The insurance program also provides coverage over temporary housing for up to 6 months whilst displaced claimants search for a new accommodation. These monthly benefit payments will vary based on the size of the household and geographic location and is calculated as follows:

The temporary housing cost used in the calculation above is based on the median price provided within the client’s demographic data. Further, coverage under the proposed program is limited to a fixed percentage of predicted involuntary displacement costs, which has been set to 60% to ensure displacement costs fall below 10% of GDP each year. 

### 2.3 Monitoring and Performance Evaluation

As this program is new, we will be required to continue monitoring its performance in the short and long-term and make necessary adjustments. For this report, we have defined our short and long-term timeframes as the following:
* Short-term: 2 years
* Long-term: 10 years

Short term monitoring should be conducted once the program has started to run so that there is sufficient data available to make relevant adjustments in the scheme for effective risk management. Lack of awareness of this newly developed social insurance program would cause delays in claims filed and insufficient data. Further, we note that the confirmation of eligibility for initial claims made will delay the full implementation of the program, particularly due to the back log of claims being processed with an inefficient system. As such, we have selected a 2-year short term period.

In contrast, long term monitoring is essential for determining the effectiveness of the proposed program and would be conducted once the scheme is fully implemented. This will allow us to ensure adequate pricing as we consider the policy's claims experience. If actual experience significantly deviates from the expected, relevant models and assumptions will need to be redesigned and updated. 

## 3 Pricing/Costs

### 3.1 Projected Costs

The simulation results for costs under program associated with voluntary relocation is as follows: 
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz4.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz5.png)
The simulation results for costs under program associated with involuntary relocation is as follows: 
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz6.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz7.png)
As shown in the tables above, costs associated with voluntary relocation are significantly lower and less volatile in comparison to involuntary displacement costs. 

### 3.2 Projected Costs without Program

The simulated projected cost associated with hazardous climate-related events for Storslysia’s citizens without the introduction of the program is summarised in the table below. 
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz8.png)
We can see that projected costs are significantly lower for voluntary relocation under the proposed program, particularly in the long term as we incentivise safer relocations to reduce risk. Costs associated with involuntary displacement are partially subsidised under the program and are therefore also reduced significantly.

### 3.3 Capital Requirements

We used the 99.5th percentile of program costs cash flows under the worst-case scenario (very high emissions) to calculate the required economic capital for program to remain solvent. As outlined in the table below, we require a cash reserve of _Ꝕ 2,223,747,478.12_ for this program. 
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz9.png)

## 4 Assumptions

### 4.1 Key Assumptions

#### 4.1.1 Involuntary Model
Simulations for projected costs for involuntary displacement were conducted under the assumption that claims frequency follows a _Poisson distribution_ and claims severity follows a _Gamma distribution_. The Poisson rate was found through the sample model provided by Storslysia, with the yearly rate interpolated under the assumption of a linear trend between decades. 

Weather events in the medium to major categories are assumed to occur less frequently (e.g. once a decade) and so we have adopted a 30-year average as the expected 2020 frequency in the sample model. Estimates for the Gamma scale and shape parameters were determined by fitting the data on property damages for each event category. Simulations for minor events were not found due to limitations on program coverage for damages which do not exceed 30% of property value.

When projecting costs for temporary accommodation, we have assumed a fixed period of 6 months for all claimants to account for the worst-case scenario and have based the number of people per household on the average provided in the most recent census data. The number of households affected was estimated by dividing the total property damage per hazard event by the median property value.

#### 4.1.2 Voluntary Model
We have used property value as a proxy for socio-economic status within our models under the assumption that all residents will spend a fixed proportion of income on property. We have defined geographic risk from most risky to least risky as follows:
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz10.png)

These rankings form the basis of our movements frequency assumptions between regions along with population density, average regional income, living expenses and ease of entry into the region. For simplicity of the model and due to the limited relevant data available, we have assumed these to be the only factors which affects claimants’ decisions to voluntarily relocate.
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz11.png)

We have assumed a fixed relocation rate (outlined in the table above) and total number of households within Storslysia over the course of the social insurance program. As such, we expect the number of households by regions to evolve following a Markov process. 
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz12.png)

Property values for each region were assumed to follow a _Uniform distribution_ within each bin, with the mean and variance of the estimated distributions computed for each region based on data provided by Storslysia. As the number of households relocating between regions was too large, simulating the property value of every movement would be computationally heavy and time-consuming. As such, the overall property value movement was assumed to follow a _Normal distribution_ according to the Central Limit Theorem, with parameters equal to the previously calculated aggregate mean and variance respectively. 

## 5 Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations

### 5.1 Key Risks

We have implemented the Risk Categorisation and Definition (RCD) tool to identify 12 key risks associated with this policy. Below, we summarised these risks and potential mitigation techniques to be implemented.

![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz14.png)
### 5.2 Sensitivity Analyses

Given the level of uncertainty surrounding climate-related events, we have conducted sensitivity analyses on the proposed program to determine the financial impact of the difference between actual and expected costs under favourable and unfavourable scenarios. Our baseline projected costs outlined in Section 3.1 assumes that carbon emission levels will be low over the next decade. The table below summarises the projected costs (IUD) for the program for varying levels of carbon emission.
![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Viz13.png)

As expected, the short-term costs of our program have relatively low volatility which then increases in the long term in response to global warming. We can see that as emission levels increase, experience becomes more unfavourable in the long term as more catastrophic climate-related events increase in prevalence. Regardless, projected costs still remain below 10% of GDP with 90% certainty under each scenario tested. 

We have also tested for the impact of a healthy and recessive economic environment below. During a healthy economic environment _(GDP growth = 5% and Inflation rate = 2%)_, the inflation rate is maintained at a relatively low level and Storslysia’s GDP is experiencing healthy growth, driving up the confidence level. 

![alt text](https://github.com/WinsonLui/ACTL4001-Assignment/blob/6fd997d32b012f18ba5e9a9ac635868386df8039/Graphs/Graph1.png)

In contrast, under economic recessions _(GDP growth = 0% and Inflation rate = 10%)_, the inflationary environment will push the costs up, resulting in a lower confidence level, especially in the long term.

### 5.3 Degrees of Certainty

As mentioned in Section 2.2, a fixed portion of total economic costs are covered under our proposed social insurance program. As such, the economic costs associated with the program will always be less than the economic costs for Storslysia without the program.

We have set the fixed portions to be 70% for voluntary costs and 60% for involuntary costs to ensure that total costs will not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s GDP in any given year within the short and long-term timeframes selected with 90% certainty. We have selected a 90% certainty level to get a reasonable estimate without placing too much dependence on the data provided given the limitations set out in Section 6.2.
