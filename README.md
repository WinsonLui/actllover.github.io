_Social insurance program design for catastrophic climate-related displacement risk management_

---

## 1 Objectives

### 1.1 Objective of Proposed Program Design

Our team has been requested by Storslysia to design a social insurance program which provides coverage for both voluntary and involuntary displacement. The purpose of the program is to manage Storslysia’s exposure to displacement risk arising from catastrophic climate-related events, and to prevent relocation costs from exceeding 10% of its GDP each year with 90% certainty. Storslysia has confirmed that they require the program to cover the entire population, and we have incorporated benefits varying by geographic risk and socio-economic status within the program design in response to Storslysia’s diverse geography.
